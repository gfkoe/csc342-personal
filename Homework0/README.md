# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?


I think that in general, ungrading provides a unique way for students to evaluate themselves across a fair scale. From my understanding, it seems like someone who has no experience doing something, or someone who may not have had equal opportunity to do something will be able to achieve a similar grade to someone who already has a lot of experience doing something. I also think that ungrading relieves a lot of stress from the equation of school, especially in an engineering or computer science course where there is a lot of pressure to do well. Often times I have been very overwhelmed with schoolwork in order to hit a specific grading breakpoint, and I have also felt discouraged if I received a bad grade on a test or on assignment. I believe these "bad" grades and the resulting emotions compound for a lot of students and contributes to a lot of uncessary stress.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?
