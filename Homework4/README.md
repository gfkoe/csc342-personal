2. One of the most challenging things about this project was trying to figure out how everything linked together with the different components, such as the frontend APIClient and HTTPClient, the backend APIRouter, and making the endpoint calls. I also struggled with authentication because I tried to do it a couple of different ways and then found out that we were supposed to do it how Lecture 18 did it. For working through how things linked together, I spent a lot of good time going through the lecture examples and tracing through them, and I think I learned a lot from that.
3. I think that a search feature would be good to implement, and maybe could just be with an input field that tries to match the value to the value of the users, and then goes to their page if it matches, similarly to how clicking on a username works. It would probably be more complex than that since it may need to be a POST request if they are checking input, but if it was with a GET request I think that it could be simpler.
